platform. It is written in Node.JS / JavaScript and uses MongoDB as a backing
store. It is published under the BSD license.

`Strider` is conceptually similar to Travis-CI or Jenkins with the following
major differences:

* A focus on Continuous Deployment rather than just Continuous Integration
* Designed to be easy to install & setup
* Deployable & usable on Heroku free plan
* Intended for deployment on private infrastructure
* An emphasis on extensibility. Plugins are powerful, easy to write and simple to install.
* Out-of-the-box support for projects written in Node.JS, Python (generic and Django/Pyramid) and Selenium/Sauce Labs tests
* Commercial support, consulting & hosting available
* Coming soon: Ruby/Rails, JVM languages, PHP and more
